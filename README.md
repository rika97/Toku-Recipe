## **🛒 Shopping Lists**
Create shopping lists with the option to select the importance of each item. Users can save money by planning on what to buy at the grocery store beforehand, preventing them from buying items they don't need.

## **🥑 Fridge Stock**
Users can also manage items in their fridge and keep track of expiry dates so that they can grasp which items to use for their next meal before they go spoilt.
Recipe recommendations are also given by a simple click, depending on the items that the user currently has.

## **🍽 Recipes**
Recipes can be created and shared with other users. The search form provides the ability to search for recipes by title, ingredients, cuisine, and category.

## **Roadmap 🚘**
Currently, this app is still in development phase. The ultimate goal of this app is to fully automate the process of users' cooking chores.
Users can post recipes and create stock/shopping lists, but here are some tasks for future steps:
1. Calculate nutritional information automatically for each of the recipes from its ingredients.
2. Calculate missing ingredients required to make a recipe.
3. Create meal planning scheduler and allow users to add recipes to their schedules to automatically add missing ingredients to shopping list.
4. Send notifications to user when they need to go shopping.
5. Subtract ingredients from stock list (correct portions) when recipes are cooked.
6. Create meal planning schedules depending on 3 modes: 1. reducing food expense 2. reducing food waste 3. managing a healthy diet
7. Collect enough user data to create a good machine learning model on predicting user ratings for each of the recipes and optimize the recommendations.
8. Create a Japanese version of the app (due to employment restrictions) and add affiliate coupons (a win-win for both the user and the app.)
9. Storing images on MongoDB takes a lot of time retrieving data -> find other solutions for posting images.
